Installation
=============

Typically a LyX template consists of following files:
*.cls     - TeX class file
*.layout  - LyX format/layout file
*.lyx     - LyX template file
(*.tex    - TeX sample file)

Mac OS X
--------
Find the location of your latex installation, e.g., /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ and copy the ifacconf files according to the folder structure provided (bibtex/..., tex/...)

Find the location of your LyX installation files, e.g., ~/Library/Application Support/LyX-2.4/ and copy the ifacconf files according to the folder structured provided (layouts/, templates/).

After installation:
-----------------------------
'sudo texhash' - to make TeX aware of the new class
'LyX -> Reconfigure' - to make LyX aware of the new files.

=============
Usage
=============
To check that everything works (including the figure), directly open the ifacconf.lyx file from the templates/ folder.

For a new document:
In LyX: File > New from Template...
When inserting a Bib(la)TeX Bibliography, set no style (leave the Style field emtpy), because the style is already set in the document settings/in the .cls file.
